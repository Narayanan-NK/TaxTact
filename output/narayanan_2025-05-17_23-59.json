  "ai_plan": "⚠️ Using fallback model (gemini-1.5-flash) due to quota limits.\n\n## 3-Year Financial Strategy\n\nThis plan focuses on achieving your child planning goals while managing existing debt and building a strong financial foundation.  Given your moderate risk appetite and preference for PPF, the strategy incorporates a mix of conservative and growth-oriented investments.\n\n### I. Debt Management\n\n* **Loan Repayment:** Prioritize repayment of your ₹110,000 loan within the next year.  A prepayment strategy, if feasible, will save you on interest.  Consider utilizing a portion of your annual savings for this.\n\n### II. Insurance\n\n* **Term Insurance:**  Crucial given your family responsibilities. Secure a term insurance policy with a coverage of at least 10 times your annual income (₹14,000,000). This is essential to protect your family's financial future in case of unforeseen events.\n* **Health Insurance:**  A comprehensive health insurance plan for yourself and your children is also vital. Choose a plan with adequate coverage to meet potential medical expenses.\n\n### III. Investment Strategy\n\n* **Child Planning Corpus:**  The ₹700,000 target for child planning within 6 years is achievable with disciplined SIP investments.  However, considering your preference for PPF, which offers a relatively lower return compared to market-linked instruments,  diversification is recommended to accelerate your goal.\n\n* **Diversified Investment Approach:**  While PPF is a good option for long-term tax benefits, a portion of your investment should go towards other moderate-risk avenues like ELSS mutual funds to enhance returns. Consider a 60:40 split between PPF and ELSS mutual funds.\n\n* **SIP Strategy and Projections:**\n\n| Year | Beginning Balance (₹) | SIP Contribution (₹) | Estimated Returns (₹) | Ending Balance (₹) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | 100,000 | 180,000 | 18,000 | 300,000 |\n| 2 | 300,000 | 180,000 | 36,000 | 516,000 |\n| 3 | 516,000 | 180,000 | 51,600  | 747,600 |\n\n\n*Note:  This projection assumes a 10% annual return on your SIP investments which can vary.*  Re-evaluate your portfolio annually.\n\n### IV. Tax Planning\n\n| Feature          | Old Regime                               | New Regime                               |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Tax Slabs        | Multiple slabs with varying rates          | Multiple slabs with varying rates           |\n| Deductions      | 80C, 80D, HRA, etc.                       | 80C, 80CCD (1B), some others are limited    |\n| Investment Options| PPF, ELSS, Life Insurance, Home Loan        |Similar, but strategies might differ based on individual circumstances |\n| Overall           |More deductions, better for higher income  |Simplified, may be better for lower income|\n\n\n*Consult a tax professional for personalized advice, considering your specific income and investments.*\n\n### V. Housing\n\n* **Rent vs. Buy:**  Since you already own a home,  this is not a primary concern in your short-term plan. However, long-term housing needs should be a part of your future financial plan.\n\n### VI. Estimated Net Worth Growth\n\n| Year | Beginning Net Worth (₹) | Income (₹) | Savings (₹) | Investment Growth (₹) | Loan Repayment (₹) | Ending Net Worth (₹) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | 100,000 | 1,400,000 | 280,000 | 30,000 | 110,000 | 600,000 |\n| 2 | 600,000 | 1,540,000 | 308,000 | 51,600 | 0 | 959,600 |\n| 3 | 959,600 | 1,694,000 | 338,800 | 74,760 | 0 | 1,373,160 |\n\n*Note: This is an estimation and does not account for potential inflation or unexpected expenses.  Investment returns are subject to market fluctuations.*\n\n\nThis is a suggested plan. It’s crucial to regularly review and adjust this plan based on your changing circumstances, market conditions, and your evolving financial goals. Consulting with a qualified financial advisor for personalized advice is highly recommended.\n"
