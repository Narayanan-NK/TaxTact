Consider increasing contributions based on surplus funds.\n* **ELSS:** Invest a significant portion of the remaining investable amount in ELSS funds via SIPs for long-term growth and tax benefits (Section 80C).  High risk appetite allows for higher allocation to equities.\n* **PPF:** Consider supplementing ELSS investments with PPF for a mix of growth and stability.\n* **Insurance:** Ensure adequate life and health insurance coverage based on individual needs and risk profile.  Parental health insurance should also be considered.\n\n**Specific Allocation (Illustrative):**  Allocation depends on risk tolerance and market conditions; this is an example only.\n\n| Investment     | Allocation (%) | Rationale                                         |\n|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Emergency Fund  | 10-20            | Liquidity and risk mitigation                       |\n| NPS              | 20-30            | Tax benefits, long-term growth, Pension provision |\n| ELSS (SIPs)     | 40-50            | High growth potential, tax benefits                    |\n| PPF              | 10-20            | Stability and assured returns                      |\n| Insurance        |  Remaining       | Risk mitigation                                      |\n\n\n**3.
